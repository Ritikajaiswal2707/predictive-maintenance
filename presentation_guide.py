    "Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today I'll demonstrate our 
    AI-powered Predictive Maintenance System that prevents equipment 
    failures before they happen.
    
    This system monitors industrial equipment in real-time and sends 
    instant SMS alerts when problems are detected, saving companies 
    millions in downtime and emergency repairs."

    print("""
    "Traditional maintenance is reactive - we fix equipment after 
    it breaks. This leads to:
    
    - Unexpected downtime costing $50,000+ per hour
    - Emergency repairs 3-5x more expensive
    - Safety risks from sudden failures
    - Production delays and customer impact
    
    Our solution transforms this into proactive, intelligent maintenance."

    "Our system uses advanced machine learning to:
    
    1. Monitor equipment health continuously
    2. Predict failures hours or days in advance
    3. Send real-time alerts via SMS
    4. Provide actionable maintenance recommendations
    
    We monitor pumps, compressors, and other critical equipment with 
    sensors tracking vibration, temperature, pressure, and current."

    [Run: python live_demo.py]
    
    As you can see:
    
    Demo 1: Normal operation - No alerts, equipment healthy
    Demo 2: Warning condition - SMS alert sent to maintenance team
    Demo 3: Critical condition - Multiple SMS alerts sent immediately
    
    Notice how the system automatically detects problems and sends 
    alerts to maintenance teams instantly, even when they're not 
    at their computers."

    - Clear, actionable messages
    - Severity levels (Warning/Critical/Emergency)
    - Equipment details and current values
    - Immediate notification delivery
    
    This ensures maintenance teams are notified instantly,

    - Prevents unexpected equipment failures
    - Reduces maintenance costs by 30-50%
    - Minimizes production downtime
    - Extends equipment lifespan
    - Improves safety and reliability
    
    For a typical manufacturing plant, this system can save 
    $500,000 to $2 million annually in avoided downtime."

    - Machine Learning: Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks
    - Real-time Processing: 1000Hz sensor data processing
    - Multi-channel Alerts: SMS, Email, Dashboard notifications
    - Scalable Architecture: Handles 1000+ equipment units
    - International SMS: Works globally via Twilio
    
    The system achieves 95%+ accuracy in fault detection 
    and predicts failures with high precision."
